# FPGAppy Bird
This project was created for a course in digital electronics on the fifth semester
of Electronics and Computer Engineering at the University of Southern Denmark.

The project is an FPGA implementation of the game "Flappy Bird" using a Digilent
Nexys 2 Spartan-3E FPGA trainer board and a Digilent PmodAD1 analog-to-digital converter.
The code was developed using Xilinx ISE 14.7 on Ubuntu 18.04.

## Project description
In the classic *Flappy Bird* game, the player controls a bird and must avoid obstacles
by pressing a button to make the bird fly higher. In this project, the bird is instead
controlled via an analog input (potentiometer, IR sensor or something else) that determines
the bird's absolute vertical position of the screen.
